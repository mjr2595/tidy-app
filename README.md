# Tidy!

## Cleaning app todo list thingy for folks with poorÂ executive function

The idea is to assist with quick tidying up around your home. You pick how much time you have (5, 10, 15, 30, 60 mins) and the app will pick a random todo/chore from your chore list. Each chore is weighted with the amount of time it takes. Either complete the given task or decline, but either way you will continnue to be prompted with tasks until you've depleted all your available time.
